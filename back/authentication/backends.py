        """
        The `authenticate` method is called on every request regardless of
        whether the endpoint requires authentication.

        `authenticate` has two possible return values:

        1) `None` - We return `None` if we do not wish to authenticate. Usually
                    this means we know authentication will fail. An example of
                    this is when the request does not include a token in the
                    headers.

        2) `(user, token)` - We return a user/token combination when
                             authentication is successful.

                            If neither case is met, that means there's an error
                            and we do not return anything.
                            We simple raise the `AuthenticationFailed`
                            exception and let Django REST Framework
                            handle the rest.
